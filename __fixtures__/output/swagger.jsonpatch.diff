from a simple string type to a proper union type (string | number).

Key Changes:
- Original: export type IntOrString = string;
- Patched:  export type IntOrString = string | number;

This affects all properties that use IntOrString, making them accept both
string and number values as originally intended by the Kubernetes API.
